## MEWTRACK and MEWAI
### <img src="https://img.icons8.com/?size=100&id=0GsgN38nhCVH&format=png&color=000000" alt="Pose detection Icon" width="24"> MEWTRACK (Pose Detection System)
Mewfit integrates MEWTRACK, a high-performance pose detection model, to track users' movements in real-time. MEWTRACK is optimized for speed and accuracy, making it suitable for fitness applications. It can recognize key points of the body and provide feedback on exercise posture, helping users maintain proper form and reduce the risk of injury.

While MEWTRACK is highly effective, it is not perfect and may occasionally misinterpret certain movements, particularly in low-light conditions or when the camera angle is suboptimal. Users should use the detected poses as guidance rather than definitive evaluations.

## <img src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/error--v1.png" alt="Warning Icon" width="24"> Warning
Please note that the pose detection feature in Mewfit relies on advanced algorithms, which may not always provide highly accurate results. The detected poses should be used as a reference to guide your workouts rather than as a definitive assessment of your movements.
